// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var countries = ["Turkey", "Saudi Arabia", "Manchester", "Switzerland", "Italy"];
