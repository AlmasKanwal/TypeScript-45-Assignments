// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries:string[] = ["Turkey", "Saudi Arabia", "Manchester", "Switzerland", "Italy"];

console.log("List Of Countries");
countries.map((item)=> console.log((item)));
