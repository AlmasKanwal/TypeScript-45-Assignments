// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

type car = {
    manufacturer: string
    model: string
    [key: string]: any;
}

function create_car(manufacturer: string, model: string, optional: Record<string, any>){
    return{
        manufacturer,
        model,
        ...optional
    }
}

const mycar: car = create_car("Toyota Indus", "Corolla X", { color: "Black", year: "2024"})
console.log(mycar)
