// Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
// You should create four lines that look like this:
// console.log(5 + 3)
// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.
// addition
var a = 6;
var b = 2;
console.log(a + b);
// subtraction
var c = 10;
var d = 2;
console.log(c - d);
// multiplication
var e = 4;
var f = 2;
console.log(e * f);
// division
var g = 16;
var h = 2;
console.log(g / h);
